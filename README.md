NAME
====

Rakudo::Version - provide a "rakudo version" pragma

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
# Exactly this version
use rakudo v2022.01;

# From this version onward
use rakudo v2023.02+;

# More elaborate checks with a Callable
use rakudo { $_ ~~ v2022.01 || $_ ~~ v2022.07+ }

# Custom error message
use rakudo {
    $_ ~~ v2022.07+ || die "$_ is not recent enough for this"
}
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

The Rakudo::Version distribution provides a `use rakudo` pragma that allows one to specify with which version of Rakudo a program is supposed to run.

Version checking occurs either by specifying a `Version` value (which will be smart-matched with the current compiler `Version`), or it can be a `Callable` which will be given the current `Version` value, and which should return a `Bool` indicating whether or not the Rakudo release is acceptable.

PRIOR ART
=========

The [RakudoPrereq](https://raku.land/zef:raku-community-modules/RakudoPrereq) module, originally by `Zoffix Znet`, provides a more general approach to the problem of limiting a program to a specific release.
